# Tolerance 

Math representation of the physically needed permissible deviation of measures in rust avoiding floating point 
inaccuracy.  

Based of an own type `Myth` with a accuracy of 1/10th my-meter (= 0.1Î¼).

### Example
```rust
use tolerance::T128;

fn main() {
    let width1 = T128::new(100.0, 0.05, -0.2);
    let width2 = T128::with_sym(50.0, 0.05);

    // Adding two `T128`s is strait-forth.
    assert_eq!(width1 + width2, T128::new(150.0, 0.1, -0.25));

    // `!` inverts the direction of tolerance to /subtract/ measures.
    assert_eq!(!width1, T128::new(-100.0, 0.2, -0.05));

    // Adding an inverted `T128` wides the tolerance.
    assert_eq!(width1 + !width1, T128::new(0.0, 0.25, -0.25));
}
```

### Limits 

#### T128

A 128bit wide value. Based on a `Myth64` (64bit) for the value it could handle sizes up to +/-922_337_203 km 
with a deviation of +/-214 m (`Myth32`). 

#### T64

based on a `Myth32` (32bit) for the value it could handle sizes up to +/-214 m
with a deviation of +/-3 mm (`Myth16`).
