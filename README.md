Math representation of the physically needed permissible deviation of measures.
Avoiding floating point inaccuracy by calculating with 4 fractional digits.
Allows to calculate with tolerance ranges in a consistent way.

## Description
The two tolerance-types [`T128`] and [`T64`] handles the 3 values of the tolerance: the par (value) and it's 2
deviations (plus & minus).
Based of own types [`Myth64`], [`Myth32`], [`Myth16`] with a accuracy of 1/10th my-meter (= 0.1Î¼).

### T128
Based on a [`Myth64`] (64bit) for the value it could handle sizes up to +/-922_337_203 km with a deviation of +/-214 m ([`Myth32`]).

### T64
Based on a [`Myth32`] (32bit) for the value it could handle sizes up to +/-214 m with a deviation of +/-3 mm ([`Myth16`]).

### Example

```rust
use tolerance::T128;

let width1 = T128::new(100.0, 0.05, -0.2);
let width2 = T128::with_sym(50.0, 0.05);

// Adding two `T128`s is straightforward.
assert_eq!(width1 + width2, T128::new(150.0, 0.1, -0.25));

// `!` inverts the direction of tolerance to /subtract/ measures.
assert_eq!(!width1, T128::new(-100.0, 0.2, -0.05));

// Adding an inverted `T128` wides the tolerance.
assert_eq!(width1 + !width1, T128::new(0.0, 0.25, -0.25));
```
